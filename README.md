# web_rm_template
Website template build with R Markdown.

You can visit this template at: https://mortenlorenzen.github.io/web_rm_template/

Since this site is published with GitHub pages the html folder needs to be named "docs". I do this by adding *output_dir: "docs"* in the "_site.yml" file. Otherwise is the default foldername "_site".

I have build 2 website templates (repo: web_rm_template and web_distill_template), one with RMarkdown only and one with RMarkdown and the distill package. Regarding the content is the main difference, that the distill website includes a blog.

The idea is to have a **minimal website skeleton** for my needs. Be aware that some text is in danish :)

You are welcome to get inspired and go for the code.
